7 (of 7) markers to be included from [ famctrl.map ]
14 individuals read from [ famctrl.ped ] 
14 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
4 cases, 10 controls and 0 missing
7 males, 7 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 7 SNPs
10 founders and 4 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 7 SNPs
After filtering, 4 cases, 10 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 7 males, 7 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Writing pedigree information to [ famctrl.fam ] 
Writing map (extended format) information to [ famctrl.bim ]
